I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Politics and International Studies and a recipient of the [Chancellor’s International Scholarship](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/dc/schols_fund/scholarships_and_funding/chancellors_int/) (2019-2023). Before beginning my PhD at Warwick I completed an MSc in Political Science at the University of Montreal.
