My broader research interests comprise **emotion research in International Studies** as well as **political and social psychology**, with a comparative focus on the **European Union** and the **everyday**. My different projects all fall under this umbrella but tend to be articulated alongside two strands of work with diverse emphasis and outcomes: **research on citizens and the everyday**, and research on **political discourse at the macro-level**. 

First, my PhD thesis situates itself in the first strand of research on the everyday and individuals, as it explores the question of citizens’ **perspectives on further European (dis)integration and the future of the European Union (EU) after Brexit**. Whilst most of my projects employ qualitative methods, my thesis uses a comparative mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative data from twenty-one focus groups which took place in four countries (Belgium, France, Italy, and Portugal) with different socio-economic and demographic groups, and survey data. 

I am also working on some related projects that focus on citizens and the everyday, notably by looking at **ontological security-seeking practices**, and **narratives**. This latter is a dimension I investigated specifically in a separate collaborative project on European narratives with Laurie Beaudonnet (Université de Montréal), Céline Belot (Sciences Po Grenoble), Hélène Caune (Sciences Po Grenoble), and Damien Pennetreau (UCLouvain), which has been published in the _Journal of Common Market Studies_. The research design of the data collection for this piece was also published as an article in _Politique européenne_ with Laurie Beaudonnet (Université de Montréal), Céline Belot (Sciences Po Grenoble), Hélène Caune (Sciences Po Grenoble), Claire Dupuy (UCLouvain), Morgan Le Corre Juratic (European University Institute), Damien Pennetreau (UCLouvain), Tiago Silva (University of Lisbon), Virginie Van Ingelgom (UCLouvain).

Second, I am also interested in macro-level political discourses, notably when intersecting with the psychological processes underlying them. This is best illustrated through my collaborative work on two different research topics: the **politicisation of the European Union**, and the **use of EU narratives by national governments**. On the one hand, I have had the chance to work on the co-edition of a collective volume on the implications of EU politicisation, that is, the increase in salience, polarisation, and resonance of the EU issue, a flourishing research agenda of interest for academics and practitioners alike. In addition to the editorial work, I have also co-written the introductory chapter of the book with the other editors, Thomas Laloux (UCLouvain), Morgan Le Corre Juratic (European University Institute), Heidi Mercenier (Vrije Universiteit Brussels), Damien Pennetreau (UCLouvain), and Alban Versailles (UCLouvain), which proposes a more critical angle on research on politicisation, as well as a research agenda. 

On the other hand, within this broad field of studies, my interest lies in the role of emotions in the politicisation process, on which I have worked mainly in close collaboration with a fellow PhD student, Nicolai Gellwitzki (University of Warwick). Our investigation of the **emotional outcomes of EU politicisation** in the German discourse during the so-called migration crisis of 2015 resulted in research outputs such as a prize-winning working paper and a peer-reviewed chapter in the previously mentioned edited volume. Moreover, we developed a theorisation of the **role of emotions in politicisation processes**, which was published in the _Journal of Common Market Studies_.
